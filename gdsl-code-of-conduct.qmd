# Section  3 Decisions

## Types of Decisions

We will differentiate between different types of decisions:

-   Critical decisions: These are decisions that will significantly impact GDSL as a collective or large segments of the group. These include strategic decisions about the management and functioning of the lab.

-   Non-critical decisions: These are decisions that will not impact GDSL as a collective or large segments of the group in any significant way. These include day-to-day decisions such as the cancelling or postponing of lab meetings, brown bags and workshops.

-   Time-sensitive decisions: These are decisions which require a rapid decision. These types of decisions can intersect with those above i.e. there could be critical time-sensitive decisions or non-critical time-sensitive decisions.

All these decisions will be handled in different ways.

## Critical decisions

For critical decisions, the following procedure will be used:

### Decision options and discussion

-   When there is a critical decision to be made, the Lead and Deputy Lead will be responsible to share a written account of the decision to be made via email or appropriate Teams channel before the staff and postdoc meeting in which issues will be discussed and considered.

-   When sharing the meeting agenda, any critical decisions to be discussed during the meeting will be flagged.

-   During the meeting, all GDSL members will have an opportunity to share their ideas and provide their perspectives.

-   The discussion will end when we will identify and agree a list of potential alternative decisions.

-   These alternatives will be put up for a vote

### Voting procedures

Voting may be conducted at a meeting of the Faculty, by email or Teams channel.

1.  On all ballots, a voting member may vote: affirmative, negative, abstain, or recuse.
2.  All staff and post-doctoral members are authorized to vote. All members have equal voting rights.
3.  A simple majority is defined as 51% or greater of the votes cast as affirmative, negative, and abstain.
4.  A super majority is defined as 67% or greater of the votes cast as affirmative, negative, and abstain.
5.  Balloting done at meetings shall be extended to any non-attending members via email or Teams channel. If a GDSL member has a business-related conflict for a meeting, the member may submit their ballot by email or Teams.
6.  A clear deadline will be given for the closing of the poll. In other words, there should be a minimum waiting period of 3 days after the announcement or discussion of a topic before the closing of the poll. Votes after the deadline will not be considered.
7.  A minimum of fifteen GDSL members need to vote in order for the result to be valid.
8.  Proxy ballots are not allowed.
9.  Normally a simple majority as defined in the previous section shall be needed to approve a motion. Per voice vote at a meeting, a super majority can be required to approve a motion.

### What happens in the case of 50 / 50

-   If no consensus is reached upon a topic, a new vote if issued following another GDSL meeting.

## Non-critical decisions

## Time-sensitive decisions
